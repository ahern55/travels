# My Travel Pictures!

A photo gallery of the pictures I have taken while traveling!

## Live: [travels.jasonahern.com](https://travels.jasonahern.com)

## Services

### ☁️ [**Cloudinary**](https://cloudinary.com/) for storing the photos

### 🚀 [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/) for hosting

That's all! I am using the free tiers for both.

## Acknowledgements and Resources

I used Vercel's [Image Gallery Starter](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/image-gallery-starter) to get started with this project! I've adapted and simplified it heavily to fit my interests, but it was a great place to start 😀

Also, the styles are a bit messy now, using both Tailwind and MaterialUI... just doing my best 😅

more documentation coming soon... maybe...

feel free to reach out with any questions while I procrastinate the documentation!
